# NOTES,,,,
# bounty : line ID. Must be unique across all mods. I recommend a prefix,,,,
# variant : ID of the ship variant to use. Will not be autofitted but will have Reinforced Bulkheads added to it for spice,,,,
# factions : faction IDs the flagship will spawn for. Factions have to be regular bounty targets i.e. no knights_of_ludd rare flagships sorry (just set them to Luddic Church),,,,
# weight : spawn chance of the flagship when a bounty for one of the allowed factions is selected to receive a rare flagship (default 15% chance),,,,
# NOTE: spawn weight is further modified by the difference between the flagship's FP cost and the FP cost of the normal flagship the bounty would have had,,,,
# i.e. if you put a 1000FP variant in here with a spawn weight of 200 it might be closer to 0.002 in practice (assuming there are other rare flagship options for that faction),,,,
# also a null rare flagship at weight 1.0 is always added to the list to reduce incidence of extremely out-of-FP-band rare flagships,,,,
# source : string that will show in the bounty intel panel. Be creative,,,,
